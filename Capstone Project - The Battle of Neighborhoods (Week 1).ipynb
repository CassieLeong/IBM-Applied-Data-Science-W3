    "I like to build a restaurant in the Centre Business District (CBD) of Sydney. Barangaroo Ave is a vibrant place and it is a new district that is not more than 3 years of operates. Barangaroo is Australia's premier commercial hub for the Asia Pacific region, offering scale and quality on par with the world’s best office precincts and located on our world famous Sydney Harbour. It is designed to house approximately 23,000 office workers and some of Sydney’s best retailers and restaurants, Barangaroo is now open for business.\n",

    "To open a restaurant is not easy, yet competitive, especially in Barangaroo. Hence, it is critical to pick the right choice of restaurant to opened in Barangaroo. I also like to open the restaurant within 10 miles radius of the center of Barangaroo because there is most of the movement of human and transport. "
